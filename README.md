## Test task
Task is to implement an API that can do following:
* Sign up / Sign in for a user
  * Email / Password credentials is a must
  * OAuth via Google - additional, nice to have, not required
* Update user's name, email, password (Authenticated, partial updates are OK)
* User can create a poll (Authenticated)
  * Poll is a set of sections and questions within those sections (see below)
* User can modify the default poll, but it should not affect other users (Authenticated)
* User can list all the polls available. Either default one or user created ones (Authenticated)
* User can make a poll public, so non-registered users will be able to answer questions of the public poll (Public)
* All the answers given to a public polls are stored in the DB. They could be retrieved by poll.id.

### Default poll (always public)
* Company info (section)
  * What's your company name?
  * How many people in a company?
* Personal info (section)
  * What is your name?
  * How old are you?

### Polls details
* Polls can have unlimited amount of sections and have at least one section. 
* Every section has questions. At least one in a section.
* Questions have freeform answers

## Limitations:
* DB is Postgres
* Framework is nestjs
* Types are important
* Tests are welcomed
* Linter is set up, feel free to update linter rules

## Deliverables:
* Working API with instructions how to run it. Better if deployed somewhere (e.g. Heroku).
* Endpoints description w/contracts (Better if it's accessible Swagger)
* Description of solution drawbacks/limitations
* PR to this repo / Link to a github repo with implemented test task
